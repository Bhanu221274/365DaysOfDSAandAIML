ðŸš€ Day 7 â€“ Binary Search Algorithm

ðŸ“Œ What I Learned

âœ¨ Understood the concept of Binary Search, an efficient searching technique with O(log n) time complexity.

âœ¨ Practiced writing the algorithm in Python using a function-based approach.

âœ¨ Learned the importance of keeping the array sorted before applying Binary Search.

âœ¨ Explored how to handle user inputs dynamically and search for elements efficiently.

âœ¨ Revised how Binary Search works step by step using low, high, and mid pointers.

ðŸ“– Key Takeaways

- Binary Search is faster than Linear Search because it reduces the search space by half each time.

- Works only on sorted arrays/lists.

- Uses the concept of divide and conquer.

- Good practice for both DSA & Python coding.
