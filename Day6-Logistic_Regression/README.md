ðŸš€ Day 6 â€“ First Supervised ML Model (Logistic Regression)

Today I built my first supervised machine learning classification model using Logistic Regression ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ“Œ What I Learned

> Difference between classification and regression problems.

> How to use Logistic Regression for binary classification.

> The meaning of probabilities in predictions (predict_proba).

> Converting probabilities to class labels using a threshold (0.5 by default).

ðŸ“Œ Evaluating models using:

âœ… Accuracy

ðŸ”¢ Confusion Matrix

ðŸ“Š Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Support)

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

> Supervised Learning â†’ Training with labeled data.

> Why X must be 2D â†’ ML models expect input as (samples, features).

> Confusion Matrix â†’ Shows True/False predictions.

> Classification Report â†’ Gives a deeper evaluation beyond just accuracy.
