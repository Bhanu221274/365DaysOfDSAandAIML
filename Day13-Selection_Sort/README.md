ðŸ“˜ Day 13 â€“ Selection Sort (DSA)

ðŸ”¹ What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm where we repeatedly pick the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and place it at the correct position.

ðŸ”¹ How it Works (Step by Step Example)

Array = [4, 2, 6, 1, 8, 5]

Pass 1: Find smallest in [4,2,6,1,8,5] â†’ 1, swap with 4 â†’ [1,2,6,4,8,5]

Pass 2: Smallest in [2,6,4,8,5] â†’ 2, already in place â†’ [1,2,6,4,8,5]

Pass 3: Smallest in [6,4,8,5] â†’ 4, swap with 6 â†’ [1,2,4,6,8,5]

Pass 4: Smallest in [6,8,5] â†’ 5, swap with 6 â†’ [1,2,4,5,8,6]

Pass 5: Smallest in [8,6] â†’ 6, swap with 8 â†’ [1,2,4,5,6,8]

âœ… Final Sorted Array: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]


ðŸ”¹ Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity

Best case: O(nÂ²)

Worst case: O(nÂ²)

Average case: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(1) â†’ No extra space, done in-place

ðŸ”¹ Key Notes

Very easy to understand for beginners.

Not efficient for large datasets (O(nÂ²) comparisons).

Useful when simplicity is more important than performance.
