⭐ Day 10 – Polynomial Regression ⭐

📌 What I Learned

- Polynomial Regression is an extension of Linear Regression that allows us to fit curved relationships between features and target variables.

- Instead of just using X, we transform it into [1, X, X², X³, …] depending on the degree.

- This helps capture non-linear patterns in the data.

- Example: Marks don’t always increase in a straight line with study hours → sometimes the relationship is curved.

🧮 Formula

 - The general equation of Polynomial Regression is:
    
         y=β0​+β1​x+β2​x2+β3​x3+⋯+βn​xn

📊 Output

 - Predicted marks for 6 hours: ~25.09

 - A smooth curved line is drawn fitting the data points.

🚀 Key Takeaways

 - Linear Regression fits a straight line, but Polynomial Regression can fit curves.

 - It is powerful for datasets where relationships are non-linear.
