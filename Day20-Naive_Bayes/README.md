Day 20   

Today I explored the **Naive Bayes Classifier** and implemented a simple **Email Spam Detection model** ðŸ“§ðŸš¨  

## ðŸ”¹ What I Learned  
â€¢ Naive Bayes works on **Bayesâ€™ Theorem** and assumes features are independent.  
â€¢ Itâ€™s widely used in **text classification** problems like spam detection.  
â€¢ I used **CountVectorizer** to convert text into numbers.  
â€¢ Implemented **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, which is best for word frequency data.  
â€¢ Evaluated results using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
â€¢ Tested with new messages like:  
   - "You won a free iPhone!" â†’ **Spam ðŸš¨**  
   - "Letâ€™s meet tomorrow for lunch." â†’ **Ham âœ…**  

## ðŸ”¹ Implementation    
â€¢ Libraries: **Pandas, Scikit-learn**  
â€¢ Dataset: Created a **small sample dataset manually** with spam and ham messages.  


Excited to step into **NLP and ML models** as part of my 365-day journey ðŸš€
