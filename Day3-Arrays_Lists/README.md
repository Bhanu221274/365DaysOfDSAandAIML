ðŸ“˜ Day 3 â€“ Arrays & Lists in Python

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned Today

Array (using array module):

-Stores elements of the same data type.

-Provides memory efficiency and faster performance compared to lists.

-Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Updating.

Python List (built-in alternative):

-More flexible â€“ can store multiple data types together.

-Provides many built-in functions for easy manipulation.

-Preferred in Python for real-world coding and interviews.

ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

-Arrays are closer to low-level implementation (like in C/C++/Java).

-Lists are more powerful and commonly used in Python.

For competitive coding in Python â†’ use Lists.

Understanding arrays builds strong DSA fundamentals.
