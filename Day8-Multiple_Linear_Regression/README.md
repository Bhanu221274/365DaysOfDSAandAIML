ðŸš€ Day 8 â€“ Supervised ML: Multiple Linear Regression

ðŸ“Œ What I Learned:

âœ¨ Extended Linear Regression to handle multiple features (multi-variable regression).

âœ¨ Learned how each feature contributes to the prediction through coefficients.

âœ¨ Predicted continuous numerical values (house prices) using a combination of features.

âœ¨ Evaluated the importance of intercept and how it represents the baseline value.

âœ¨ Reinforced the concept of supervised learning and model training in Python.

ðŸ“– Key Takeaways

- Real-world prediction problems often depend on multiple input features.

- Linear Regression uses the formula:

 > y=(coef1â€‹â‹…feature1â€‹)+(coef2â€‹â‹…feature2â€‹)+â‹¯+intercept

- Each coefficient represents the impact of that feature on the prediction.

- Multi-feature regression is a foundation for advanced predictive modeling in AI/ML.
