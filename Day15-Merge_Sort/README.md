Day 15 â€“ Merge Sort âš¡


ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

- Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.

- The array is divided into halves until single elements remain.

- These halves are then merged back in sorted order.

- More efficient than Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort for large datasets.

- Stable sorting algorithm (maintains the order of equal elements).

ðŸ”¹ Complexity

- Time Complexity:

   - Best Case â†’ O(n log n)

   - Average Case â†’ O(n log n)

   - Worst Case â†’ O(n log n)

- Space Complexity â†’ O(n) (extra space needed during merging).

ðŸ”¹ Implementation

- Implemented Merge Sort using recursion in Python.
