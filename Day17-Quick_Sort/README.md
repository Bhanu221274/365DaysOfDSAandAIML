Day 17 â€“ Quick Sort âš¡

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

- Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm used for sorting.

- It works by:

   - Choosing a pivot element.

   - Partitioning the array into two parts:
      â€¢ Elements smaller than pivot â†’ left side.
      â€¢ Elements greater than pivot â†’ right side.

   - Recursively sorting the left and right subarrays.

- Unlike Merge Sort, Quick Sort does not need extra arrays for merging, making it more space-efficient.

- Time Complexity:

   - Best / Average Case â†’ O(n log n)

   - Worst Case â†’ O(nÂ²) (when pivot choice is poor, e.g., already sorted array).

- Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion).

ðŸ”¹ Example

Input Array: [8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 10, 2]

Steps:

Pivot = 2, partition â†’ [0, 1] [2] [8, 3, 7, 10]

Recursively sort left & right â†’ [0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10].
