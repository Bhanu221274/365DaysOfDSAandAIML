ðŸ“˜ Day 5 â€“ Linear Search
ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

> Linear Search checks each element one by one until the target is found.

> Useful for unsorted or small datasets.

> Introduced to Time Complexity & Space Complexity:

  - Best Case: O(1)

  - Worst Case: O(n)

  -Space: O(1)

ðŸ”¹ Example

Searching 30 in [10, 25, 7, 30, 15]:

Compare one by one â†’ Found at index 3 âœ…

ðŸ“Œ This is my first searching algorithm and my first step into complexities
