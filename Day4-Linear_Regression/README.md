Day 4 - First Supervised ML Model (Linear Regression)

📌 What I Learned Today

•Today, I built my first supervised machine learning model using Linear Regression in Python.

•Machine Learning is about teaching computers to learn patterns from data.

•Supervised Learning means the model is trained on labeled data (we already know the correct answers).

•In Linear Regression, the model tries to fit the best line through the data.

⚡ Key Concepts

Linear Equation:

•y=m⋅x+c

•m (Slope/Coefficient): How much y changes if x increases by 1.

•c (Intercept): The starting point of the line when x = 0.

Example from my dataset:

•Input (X): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

•Output (y): [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

•Learned Model: y = 10x + 0

📝 Intuition


🔑 Takeaways

•Linear regression is the simplest supervised ML model.

•The model learns slope and intercept automatically.

•Real-world data won’t always fit perfectly — that’s where ML shines by finding the best possible line.
