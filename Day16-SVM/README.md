Day 16 â€“ Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier 

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

- SVM is used for classification problems, finding the optimal boundary between classes.

- It maximizes the margin between different classes for better generalization.

- The decision boundary separates classes; margins show safe zones around it.

- Supports multiple kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle complex data.

- Visualizing the model helps understand how it classifies data points.

ðŸ”¹ Implementation

- Dataset: Student Pass/Fail based on Hours Studied & Assignments Completed.

- Trained SVC from scikit-learn with a linear kernel.

- Evaluated model using accuracy score.

- Predicted regions for all points
