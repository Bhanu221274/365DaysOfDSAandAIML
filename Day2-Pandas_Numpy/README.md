ðŸ“˜ Day 2 â€“ NumPy & Pandas Basics

Today I explored NumPy and Pandas, two of the most powerful Python libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning. ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

NumPy is like a super-fast calculator ðŸ“Š â†’ works with arrays & numbers.

Pandas is like Excel in Python ðŸ“‘ â†’ helps organize & analyze data in tables.

Using both together makes data handling easy + efficient.

ðŸ”¹ Code Explanation

Created arrays with student names & scores using NumPy.

Built a table (DataFrame) using Pandas.

Calculated average score using both NumPy & Pandas.

Found students above average with NumPyâ€™s boolean masking.

Added results back into the DataFrame for clear visualization.
