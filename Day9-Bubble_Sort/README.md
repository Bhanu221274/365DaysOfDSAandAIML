⭐ Day 9 – Bubble Sort ⭐

Today I learned and implemented Bubble Sort, one of the simplest sorting algorithms in DSA.

📘 What I Learned:

- Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order.

- After each pass, the largest element bubbles up to its correct position at the end.

- Time Complexity:

    - Worst case: O(n^2)

    - Best case (already sorted): O(n)

- Space Complexity: O(1) → sorts in-place without extra memory.

- 📝 Example:

    Unsorted: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
    Sorted (after passes): [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
